        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>Hello and welcome, this is the landing page for a redirect to some of the projects I am working on. I do other things too, artwork, reading spending time with family and cooking. I am fond of a lot of things to make use of my free time but am particularly fond of the projects which utilise the programming skills I am trying to keep up with. Here's a link to <a href="https://www.github.com/russellclarke82" target="_self">My Projects on GitHub</a>.<br><br> You'll find  a lot of them are still unfinished, this is because I get distracted with other ideas and at present do not have focus, just free reign on the Computer.<br><br>It would be great to meet some of you or talk online and come up with some sort of plan or project from concept to completion. You can find my contact details via GitHub.<br><br>I'll put my Dissertation up there for a read as it will help to understand the path I am hoping to take with some of the exploratory programming. If you have any questions. I'd be happy to answer some of them.</p>

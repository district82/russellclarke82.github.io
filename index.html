        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>Hello and welcome, this is the landing page for a redirect to some of the projects I am working on. I do other things too, artwork, reading spending time with family and cooking. I am fond of a lot of things to make use of my free time but am particularly fond of the projects which utilise the programming skills I am trying to keep up with. Here's a link to <a href="https://www.github.com/russellclarke82" target="_self">My Projects on GitHub</a>.<br><br> You'll find  a lot of them are still unfinished, this is because I get distracted with other ideas and at present do not have focus, just free reign on the Computer.<br><br>It would be great to meet some of you or talk online and come up with some sort of plan or project from concept to completion. You can find my contact details via GitHub.<br><br>I have put my <a href="https://github.com/russellclarke82/russellclarke82.github.io/blob/master/I7694005_RClarke_Dissertation_Final_Draft.pdf" target="_blank">Dissertation</a> up there for a read as it will help to understand the path I am hoping to take with some of the exploratory programming. If you have any questions. I'd be happy to answer some of them.<br><br>Also, if you fancy taking a look at some of the artwork I do it can be found on <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/albinob2" target="_self">deviant art</a>.</p>

                <p>You might notice some of my projects are incomplete. Well, I have concentration issues (yes it's a medical condition) and so with that comes a lot of ideas I have to note down in partial pseudo.<br><br>Since losing employment, I now have more time to work on those projects and so I endeavour to get some of those to you for you, the reader to take a look at.
<br><br>I prefer to write off the cuff and learn as I go, I try not to copy and paste because why? I won't learn anything and there is no challenge in copying someone else's work. This is the latest, I was pondering over MAC address generation for ages, left the partial pseudo, then finally, on to the final piece below.<br><br>There are derivatives which can be used from this and yes, I will reorganise my code into a more structured repository. What's interesting here is this is quite an intensive generation, I piped out to a file one evening and got to 5.3 GB and decided to stop. There is probably a nice logarithm out there which will be less processor intensive. Looks pretty cool though to see it finally working. Language is Python, I am learning Python, C and a few others on the fly, sorry if the other work takes a while to come to fruition.<br><br> A simple MAC address incrementer written in Python for generating hardware MAC addresses. Could be used for a silo to readdress hardware, owner and destruction of hardware for example, then have that specific address put back into the pool of addresses by way of Database per country.<br><br> Warning: The file it generates if saved to disk is very large. Well over 10GB.</p>

                <p>About time I explained this project a little (it is on the back burner for a little while). First off, I am no Mathematician, I am learning some algebra on the fly too. This was my first serious attempt at writing a program in C.<br><br>I had a brief conversation with my father about QBits, he literally asked me how much I know about them and quantum computing and I said in summary 'not a lot, probabilistic computing'. I couldn't sleep that night and was thinking about the logic of a single QBit knowing from something I'd briefly read, they consider, 1, 0 and 1 and 0 at the same time to determine a probable outcome.<br><br>I set about considering how that might be achieved programmatically. Well we have to consider either 1 or 0 and 1 and 0 and the probability, I wanted to set this in motion and add the learning element to it using a DNN (Deep Neural Network).<br><br>I chose to set about writing, following and attempting to compress two existing solutions for the DNN (detailed in the code on github) and for the probability chose the Markov Decision Process since I am already familiar with this process from my final project at University.<br><br>It's almost complete and I like the original in q2.c and the latest in q9.c. They are almost complete but need some review and verification.<br><br> I was also considering what a God particle might look like as a signal during all this code writing and mathematical exploration. It stemmed from the fusion project in the fusion repository, arriving at the conclusion it would be a sigmoid with an infinite exponent for an infinite iteration to the value of PI as it would be omnipresent cubed since it would be three dimensional. I didn't need to add the fourth dimension of time, since it is already rolling infinitely. Here's the code for the GParticulate.<br><br> The important bit is not the whole code and it's syntax but the expression(s).<br><br>Using the html notations from
<a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/math/" target="_blank"> toptal </a>and<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_greek.asp" target="_blank"> w3Schools </a>, I think the expression I am trying to complete is similar to the expression:<br><br>&#402;(x)&#8319; &#8801; &sigma;((&pi;&#183;r&#179;)&#8319;&#8734;)&#8734; <br><br>such that sigmoid &sigma; of sine wave &#8767; is of infinite scale to the N-Array &#8721; of both an infinite increment &#8710; and of the infinite Nabla or decrement &#8711; in both scales proportionally &#8733;. At least, that's the trail of thought.</p>

                <p>What I have attempted to achieve here is to find the 5th dimension which would or could be the velocity of time itself.<br><br>The though process which sparked this quest has been bugging me for years, I mean literally years. Then a few weeks ago I considered PI. <br><br>I began to think, what if the numerical values of PI should be interpreted as 3.1.4.1.5.9.2.6......and so on. What if PI is a process intelligent lifeforms have to take to reach a certain point at a given time. <br><br>That being said, 1 would be calculate, 2 two dimensions, 3 three dimensions, 4 time, 5 velocity of time, 6 and so on ...... and full stop, is time to stop and think. <br><br> The code below is pure theorem, my math is not what it could or should be and the code seems to make sense.<br><br> I have been using the html notations from
<a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/math/" target="_blank"> toptal </a>and<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_greek.asp" target="_blank"> w3Schools </a> they are very helpful, thank you.
<h4>Constant and Partial Derivative</h4><p>I have defined a constant &#402;(x) as <br><br> &#402;(x)&#8319; &#8801; &sigma;((&pi;&#183;r&#179;)&#8319;&#8734;)&#8734;<br><br>
The Partial derivative or differential &#8706; of the constant &#402;(x) would be time to leave (point &#402;A), go somewhere (velocity V over time T), and come back (point &#402;B) which is actually A minus B over T&sup3; cubed (third or physical dimension) at rate V, since we always have to be in the present. Returning - <br><br> &#8706;&#402;(x)&#8779;&#402;(&#402;A - &#402;B) / T&sup3;)&#8734; &#8757; <br><br> &#8706;&#402;(x)&#8779;((&#402;A % &#402;B) / &#8704;T)&#8734;<br><br>&#8756; V&#8779;&#8743;&#8744;&#8733;&#8706;&#402;(x)&#8734;</p>
<h4>Past Time</h4><p>
Past time PT is equal to &#8779; the partial &#8706; of the constant &#402;(x) as a remainder % of future time FT over all time &#8704;T exponentially &#8734;. Because the remainder of the future time over all time as a constant gives the past, constantly.<br><br>&#8756;  PT&#8779;((&#8706;&#402;(x) % FT) / &#8704;T)&#8734;</p>
<h4>Future Time</h4>
<p>Future time FT is all time &#8704;T divided over the partial &#8706; of the constant &#402;(x) minus past time PT. Because we have to divide all time &#8704;T over the velocity V and subtract the past to gain the future value as a continuum.<br><br>FT&#8779;((&#8704;T / &#8706;&#402;(x)) - PT)&#8734;</p>
<h4>Time</h4>
<p>Time itself &#8704;T&#8734; is a self reinforcing recurrent function as a composite of past time PT, future time FT divided over the partial derivative of the constant (Velocity) &#8706;&#402;(x) which must then be divided over itself as a summation of the N-Array &#8721; of &#8704;T&#8734; exponentially in all dimensions.<br><br>T&#8779;(((PT + FT) / &#8706;&#402;(x)) / &#8721;&#8704;T&#8734;))&#8734; <br><br>....where x in the aforementioned scenario is....<br><br>&sigma;((&pi;&#183;r&#179;)&#8319;&#8734;)&#8734;</p>
